This repository contains a Dash application that compares marginal effective tax rates of the Biden 2020 tax plan to current law, building on "The tax burden on business investment under Joe Bidenâ€™s tax proposal" (Pomerleau 2020).

Data for this project are generated using [Cost-of-Capital-Calculator](https://github.com/PSLmodels/Cost-of-Capital-Calculator) and [Tax-Calculator](https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Calculator), open-source projects housed by the Policy Simulation Library. The code that modifies the underlying models to produce the estimates reflected in the application can be found [here](https://github.com/kpomerleau/Cost-of-Capital-Calculator/tree/Tests) and [here](https://github.com/erinmelly/Tax-Calculator/tree/Biden).

The application is hosted at https://compute.studio/AEIEconomics/ccc-biden/viz/.

To run locally:

```
git clone https://github.com/Peter-Metz/ccc-widget
